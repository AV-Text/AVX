# Digital AV

The Digital AV is an software development kit (SDK) for the Authorized Version (AV) of the King James Bible. It was digitally release in 2008, but with bug fixes and minor revisions it became known as the 2011 edition.  The original SDK was just three binary files and a document that described the binary record layouts.  The final release of 2011 edition was 2017-08-15

Later the SDK was enhanced with additional features and released again as the 2018 edition.  The 2018 edition more than tripled the number of binary files.  Each file manifests additional features and capabilities.  The most recent release of the 2018 edition was 2020-07-15.

The author has plans to release the 2020 edition of the SDK in the second half of 2020.  This repository provides advanced availability, packed with additional features, and still more binary files.   The first release of the 2020 edition was also on 2020-07-15.

Each revision of the SDK can be found in this repository.  And within each folder, an SDK document can be found that describes the folder contents.

Some of the folders contain sample source code, but the SDL is primarily binary files that can be use to manifest the entire text of the the bible, along with Strongs numbers, Lemmatizations, and Part-of-Speech tags.  For details, consult the documentation.
